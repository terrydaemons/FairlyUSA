  <p>
    On the evening of July 31, 1979, FairlyUSA
    experienced an unscheduled interruption
    to its morning broadcast.

    The interruption coincided with the absence
    of the assigned on-air announcer.

    Station personnel initiated a temporary
    signal loop while attempting internal
    communication.

    At approximately 10:34 local time, the
    announcer was found deceased within
    station premises.
  </p>

  <p>
    The cause of death was later classified
    as suicide.
