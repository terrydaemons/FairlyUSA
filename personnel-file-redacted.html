  <h3>Recorded Statement (Transcript)</h3>

  <p>
    “I have been instructed not to speak about
    ██████████████████████████████████,
    but I cannot continue pretending that
    nothing is happening.”
  </p>

  <p>
    “They call themselves
    ██████████████████████████████████.
    They are not a sponsor. They are not
    an oversight committee.”
  </p>

  <p>
    “They decide what goes on the air.
    They decide what stays silent.
    They decide who keeps their job.”
  </p>

  <p>
    “I have seen documents I was never
    meant to see. I have heard voices
    during closed transmissions that do
    not belong to any operator here.”
  </p>

  <p>
    “But I have some things to say. First,
    this is NOT a █████. Well, is it, but at the
    same time these things are creatures. Creatures that are searching
    for dams. ██████████████████.”
  </p>

  <p>
   “██████████████████████████████,
    ██████████████████,
    █████████████████████████████████████,
    ██████████. █████████████████.”
  </p>

  <p>
    “When I asked questions, I was told
    to forget what I heard. When I refused,
    I was told to be careful.”
  </p>

  <p>
    “This station is not independent.
    It never was, almost really.”
  </p>

  <p>
    “If this recording is ever heard,
    then something has already gone wrong.”
  </p>
